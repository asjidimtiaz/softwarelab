# The Challenge

ShopGlobal was struggling with a bloated legacy theme that crashed every time they ran a marketing campaign. They needed a headless solution that could scale instantly.

# Our Solution

We implemented a custom **Hydrogen** storefront and moved their logic to **Oxygen** edges. We optimized every image and reduced JavaScript execution time by 75%.

# Results

The new site is essentially a progressive web app that feels native on mobile, leading to a massive spike in returning customers.
