# The Future of Agency Development

In the fast-paced world of digital products, speed is the ultimate currency. That's why at **Software Lab**, we've fully committed to the latest Next.js 16 ecosystem...

## Why Turbopack Matters

Turbopack is up to 700x faster than traditional build tools in large applications. This means:

- Instant HMR (Hot Module Replacement)
- Faster deployment pipelines
- Better developer experience

## The Power of RSC

React Server Components allow us to build complex interfaces without sending massive JavaScript bundles to your users.

### Conclusion

We are just getting started with what's possible in the laboratory.
